Not a Rory. Not a \r\nJustin. Not a Dustin.\r\nPhil Mickelson actually enjoyed a wonderful, winning career. And he's not Tiger.\r\nGod knows we media scum have tried to find, and or create, Tiger's equal.\r\nTiger last won a major in 2008, and after such a long stretch away, the 42-year-old is at last \r\nplaying competitive golf, and in doing so is here to save the game."}
