Kraft's ball hit a bird in flight and the ball dropped into the water in front the green. Kraft made a double bogey and finished at 1 over par on Harbour Town Golf Links, missing the cut by a stroke.\r\nKraft's group asked for a ruling, figuring the player would simplly retee without penalty. Instead, because the bird is not a made-made object, Kraft had to play it as a ball in the water.\r\n"}
