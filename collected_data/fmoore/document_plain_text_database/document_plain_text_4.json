Available online for free: \nhttp://nlp.stanford.edu/IR\n-book/information\n-retrieval\n-book.html\n  Additional reading resources will be provided online.\n  Course Contents\n  \ufb01This course\n introduce\ns the \nfield of \nInformation Retrieval (IR)\n, with an emphasis on its \napplication in Web search. Also introduces the basic concepts of stemming, tokenizing and \ninverted indices, text similarity metrics and the vector\n-space model. Students study popu\nlar Web \nsearch engines and apply the concepts in several java\n-based projects.\n\ufb02  Topics include\n  Boolean Retrieval\n  The Term Vocabulary and Posting List\n  Stemming and Skip pointers\n  Dictionaries and Tolerant Retrieval\n  Index Construction and Compression\n  The Vect\nor Space Model\n  IR Evaluation\n  Probabilistic Retrieval\n  Language Models for IR\n  Clustering\n  Relevance Feedback\n  Query Expansion\n  You are \nexpected to check \ufb01Canvas\ufb02\n often for course material (slides, additional readings, etc.), \nhomework assignments and grades.\n  Prerequisites\n C- or better in CSE3353 (Data Structures)\n  Grading\n  CSE 7337 Spring 201\n8 Page \n2 of \n3 Participation\n 3% Homework\n 24% Projects\n 37% Exams\n 36%          \n  Participation counts!  Ask questions, be interactive, \nand attend\n class.\n Regular class attendance \nwill be recorded\n. Distance students can demonstrate participation with a weekly email \nexplaining their progress\n or questions.\n  There will be \nsix\n homework assignments. \n There will be questions for all students \nto \ncomplete, and one additional question for CSE 7337 students. \nLate assignments will not be \naccepted except in extreme instances.\n  The project\ns are programming activities\n and will be assigned in two parts.\n   Graduate students are expected to produce quality work that is easily understood\n and \ndemonstrated an in\n-depth understanding of the problem\n.  There will be \ntwo exams\n, covering each half of the course\n.  Exams in CSE7337 are different \nfrom the exams in CSE5337.\n  Learning Outcomes\n After successful completion of this course, you should be a\nble to:\n 1.0 \n\u0152 DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY IN BASIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES\n 1.1 Understand the concept of index terms and their use in an inverted index.\n 1.2 Understand how to score and rank query results.\n 1.3\n Understand the criteria to evaluate the res\nults of a\nn IR system.\n 1.4 Understand the basic ideas of text classification and clustering.\n 2.0 \n\u0152 DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY IN AUTOMATED WEB SEARCH\n 2.1 Understand how the web is organized and its fundamental properties.\n 2.2 Understand how search engines \ncollect and index web content.\n 2.3 Understand how web search engines present the most relevant results for a given query.\n 2.4 Understand how to design and construct software that implements significant web IR concepts.\n  Academic Honesty\n Please read \ncarefully The SMU Honor Code, available at http://smu.edu/honorcouncil/default.asp. \nEach topic discussed in class will have associated homework. Students may discuss homework \nproblems and approaches with each other, but must write their solutions individua\nlly. Students may \nnot copy homework from any source, including other students or the internet. No collabo\nration is \nallowed in\n exams.\n  Studying together is encouraged. However, you are expected to do your homework and\n projects \nindependently unless stated \notherwise in the instructions. All submitted work is expected to\n be your own. \nIn particular:\n  On-line sources can be only used \nin your work when properly stated where it came from and what \nadaptations you made. Also identify under what license you are using\n the code.\n  Do not\n copy text, even if you cite the source. You have to describe the information found in the \nliterature in your own words and show how it fits into the context of your paper. \n  Disability Accommodations\n:  Students needing academic accommodat\nions for a disability must first \nregister with Disability Accommodations & Success Strategies (DASS).\n  Students can call 214\n-768\n-1470 or visit\n http://www.smu.edu/Provost/ALEC/DASS\n to begin the process.\n  Once registered, \nstudents should then schedule an appointment with the professor as early in the semester as possible, \npresent a D\nASS Accommodation Letter, and make appropriate arrangements.\n  Please note that \naccommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.\n CSE 7337 Spring 201\n8 Page \n3 of \n3   Religious Observance\n: Religiously observant students wishing to be absent on holidays that require \nmissing class should notify their professors in writing at the beginning of the semester, and should \ndiscuss with them, in advance, acceptable ways of making up any work missed because of the \nabsence. (See University Policy No. 1.9.)\n   Excused Absences for\n University Extracurricular Activities\n: Students participating in an officially \nsanctioned, scheduled University extracurricular activity should be given the opportunity to make up \nclass assignments or other graded assignments missed as a result of their p\narticipation. \n It is the \nresponsibility of the student to make arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled \nexamination or other missed assignment for making up the work.
