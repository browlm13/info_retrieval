Also introduces the basic concepts of stemming, tokenizing and \ninverted indices, text similarity metrics and the vector\n-space model. Students study popu\nlar Web \nsearch engines and apply the concepts in several java\n-based projects.\n\ufb02  Topics include\n  Boolean Retrieval\n  The Term Vocabulary and Posting List\n  Stemming and Skip pointers\n  Dictionaries and Tolerant Retrieval\n  Index Construction and Compression\n  The Vect\nor Space Model\n  IR Evaluation\n  Probabilistic Retrieval\n  Language Models for IR\n  Clustering\n  Relevance Feedback\n  Query Expansion\n  You are \nexpected to check \ufb01Canvas\ufb02\n often for course material (slides, additional readings, etc.), \nhomework assignments and grades.\n  Prerequisites\n C- or better in CSE3353 (Data Structures)\n  Grading\n  CSE 5337\n Spring 201\n8 Page \n2 of \n3 Participation\n 3% Homework\n 24% Projects\n 37% Exams\n 36%          \n  Participation counts!  Ask questions, be interactive, \nand attend\n class. \nRegular class attendance \nis expected and it will be\n recorded to monitor student participation. Undergraduates should be \naware of the University \nattendance policy\n.  There will be \nsix\n homework assignments. \n Late assignments will \nnot be accepted except in \nextreme instances.\n  The project\ns are programming activities\n and will be assigned in two parts.\n   There will be \ntwo exams, covering each half of the course.\n   Learning Outcomes\n After successful completion of this course, you should \nbe able to:\n 1.0 \n\u0152 DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY IN BASIC INFORMATION RETRIEVAL TECHNIQUES\n 1.1 Understand the concept of index terms and their use in an inverted index.\n 1.2 Understand how to score and rank query results.\n 1.3\n Understand the criteria to evaluate the results of a\nn IR system.\n 1.4 Understand the basic ideas of text classification and clustering.\n 2.0 \n\u0152 DEMONSTRATE COMPETENCY IN AUTOMATED WEB SEARCH\n 2.1 Understand how the web is organized and its fundamental propert\nies.\n 2.2 Understand how search engines collect and index web content.\n 2.3 Understand how web search engines present the most relevant results for a given query.\n 2.4 Understand how to design and construct software that implements significant web IR concepts\n.  Academic Honesty\n Please read carefully The SMU Honor Code, available at http://smu.edu/honorcouncil/default.asp. \nEach topic discussed in class will have associated homework. Students may discuss homework \nproblems and approaches with each other, but must\n write their solutions individually. Students may \nnot copy homework from any source, including other students or the internet. No collabo\nration is \nallowed in\n exams.\n  Studying together is encouraged. However, you are expected to do your homework and\n projects \nindependently unless stated otherwise in the instructions. All submitted work is expected to\n be your own. \nIn particular:\n  On-line sources can be only used \nin your work when properly stated where it came from and what \nadaptations you made. Also iden\ntify under what license you are using the code.\n  Do not\n copy text, even if you cite the source. You have to describe the information found in the \nliterature in your own words and show how it fits into the context of your paper. \n  Disability Accommodations\n:  Students needing academic accommodations for a disability must first \nregister with Disability Accommodations & Success Strategies (DASS).\n  Students can call 214\n-768\n-1470 or visit\n http://www.smu.edu/Provost/ALEC/DASS\n to begin the process.\n  Once registered, \nstudents should then schedule an appointment with the professor as early in \nthe semester as possible, \npresent a DASS Accommodation Letter, and make appropriate arrangements.\n  Please note that \naccommodations are not retroactive and require advance notice to implement.\n   Religious Observance\n: Religiously observant students wishing t\no be absent on holidays that require \nmissing class should notify their professors in writing at the beginning of the semester, and should \nCSE 5337\n Spring 201\n8 Page \n3 of \n3 discuss with them, in advance, acceptable ways of making up any work missed because of the \nabsence. (See University Po\nlicy No. 1.9.)\n   Excused Absences for University Extracurricular Activities\n: Students participating in an officially \nsanctioned, scheduled University extracurricular activity should be given the opportunity to make up \nclass assignments or other graded assignments missed as a result of their participation. \n It is the \nresponsibilit\ny of the student to make arrangements with the instructor prior to any missed scheduled \nexamination or other missed assignment for making up the work.
