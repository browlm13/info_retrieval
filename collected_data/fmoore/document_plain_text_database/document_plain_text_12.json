Light\n was the metaphor of choice. \nFor example, Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak once said that \ufb01when \nthe Internet \n\u02dcrst came, I thought it was just the beacon of freedom.\ufb02  \n  You can \neasily make a case for how much \ufb01brighter\ufb02 the world is now, thanks to ubiquitous \n\nconnectivity shining a light on misbehavior and malfeasance, but the Internet \n\nhas a dark side as well.\n    For example, when you enter a search term into Google \nand it spits out the results, you might think that the search engine spent those \n\nfew \nmilliseconds\n querying the entire Web. Nope, not even close. What Google \nindexes is a fraction of all the available Web, perhaps just 4 percent of the total, by \nsome estimates\n. That indexed soup\u00e7on is called the \nsurface Web\n, or sometimes \nthe \n visible Web\n. What about the other 96 percent? That nonsearchable content \nis called the \ndeep Web\n, dark Web\n, or sometimes the \ninvisible Web\n. A related \nidea is \ndark social\n, those online social interactions that are not public and cannot \nbe directly tracked or traced (such as text messages and emails).\n    Most of this \n hidden Web\n is obscured either because it resides within databases that are inac\n-cessible to search crawlers (because they require that information be entered into \nan HTML form), or because those crawlers don\u2122t have permission to access certain \n\ntypes of data (such as the personal info that people store within the cloud).\n  \n  \nBut \na signi\u02dccant subset of the hidden Web is the online equivalent of caves, lairs, and \n\ndungeons where hackers, criminals, and trolls gather. I speak now of the afore\n-mentioned dark Web, the collection of websites where miscreants and malefac\n-tors go to buy or sell narcotics, weapons, and stolen goods (these are known as \ndark markets\n), where the desperate and \nthe desperadoes hire hitmen and arson\n-ists, and where trolls and \n dark-side \n hackers\n gather covertly in forums and \nchat rooms. This so-called \ndarknet\n is \nhidden from view not because an HTML \n\nform is in the way but because it requires \n\nspecial tools to get there at all. The most \ncommon of these is \nTor\n, a worldwide \nnetwork of relays run by volunteers that \nanonymizes and encrypts tra\u02dac to the \nblack Web\n\u2122s typical .onion URLs (\nTor\n is short for The Onion Router).\nThe darknet seems like a place pop\n-ulated only by the lawless and the \n anarchic, but does it have anything to \no\u02dber the rest of us? Consider, for exam\n-ple, that the Tor network itself has also \n\nreceived considerable U.S. government \n\nfunding, in part to protect democratic \n\nmovements in authoritarian regimes. \n\nAnd in 2014, the broadcaster Alan Pearce \nreleased a Kindle book called \nDeep Web \nfor Journalists\n, with the aim of showing \nreporters how to keep themselves and \n\ntheir sources safe on the Internet by \n\nusing the techniques of countersurveil\n-lance, including secure communications \n\nand online anonymity. (I should note \nhere that these days people routinely \ncon\u02ddate the terms \ndeep Web\n and \ndark \nWeb\n.) Some reporters are practicing the \ntechniques of \nsecure journalism\n, which \ninclude such darknet stalwarts as secure \n\nmessaging, virtual private networking, \n\nand device encryption.\nBut there\u2122s a counterargument \nhere, which is that anonymizing your \n\nonline activity serves only to legiti\n-mize surveillance and will lead only to \n\nmore powerful snooping techniques. \n\nInstead, we should be trying to get gov\n-ernments to stop spying on their citi\n-zens. Rather than wielding powerful \n\nanonymizing tools, World Wide Web \n\ninventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee \nsays\n we \nshould be \ufb01going to protest so the world \n\noutside becomes one where you don\u2122t \n\nneed to cheat to get around this prob\n-lem.\ufb02 Let there be light. \n\u02d9\u02dc  POST YOUR COMMENTS\n at http://spectrum.ieee.org/\ntechnicallyspeaking1017\nTHE DARK DIALECT\nEvery aspect of human technology has a dark side, including the \nbow and arrow.  \n\u0160Margaret Atwood \nTECHNICALLY SPEAKING_BY PAUL McFEDRIESOPINION"}
