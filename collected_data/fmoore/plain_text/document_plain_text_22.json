{"body": "Basketball is a limited-contact sport played on a rectangular court. While most often played as a team sport \r\nwith five players on each side, three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one competitions are also common. The \r\nobjective is to shoot a basketball (approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through a hoop 18 inches in\r\n diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) high that is mounted to a backboard at each end of the court. The game was \r\n invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith.\r\n\r\nA team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team \r\nduring regular play. A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind \r\nthe three-point line, and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, \r\nwhich are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. The team with the most points \r\nat the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) is mandated when the score is tied at the end of \r\nregulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by passing it to a teammate, or by bouncing it while \r\nwalking or running (dribbling). \r\n", "document_id": 22, "content_hash": "a6246140ed639ff964c119393fed34ce", "title": null}
